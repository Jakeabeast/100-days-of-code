Today was creating a maze solving algorithm on another platform.
The site is called Reeborg's World: https://reeborg.ca/index_en.html  

The problem involved spawning in a mave on a random tile in a random direction.
The algorithm solution I created involved following the edge of the right wall making sure to initally move till touching any wall (else might result in infinite loop)

If you want to follow along:
- paste in the link above
- click a site link that directs you to the coding problems
- look for 'Maze' in top left
- paste solution below (some definitions below are predetermined on the site [e.g turn_left()])

def turn_right():
    for _ in range(3):
        turn_left()
        
def left_is_clear():
    turn_left(); turn_left()
    clear = right_is_clear()
    turn_left(); turn_left()
    return clear

#make sure we spawn next to wall
while front_is_clear():
    move()
#orientate self so a wall is to our right
while right_is_clear():
    turn_left()

#begin algorithm loop
while not at_goal():
    #Can you move right?
    if right_is_clear():
        turn_right()
        move()
    #Can you move forward?
    elif front_is_clear():
        move()
    #Can you move left?
    elif left_is_clear():
        turn_left()
        move()
    #Reverse!
    else:
        turn_left(); turn_left()
        move()
