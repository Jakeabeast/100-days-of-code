DAY 10 PROJECT - Calculator

The goal of this project is to use create a calculator where the user can use an operation one step at a time. 
For this project and hopefully onwards, I wont to try dedicating more commits to smaller chunks of code.
This should help make it more clear what has been done and prepares me for future version control princples.

    def __add():

    def __subtract():
        pass

    def __multiply():

    def update():

if __name__ == "__main__":
    calc = Calculator()

    while calc.calculating == True:
        calc.input()
        calc.update()
        calc.output()

    print("Goodbye")
