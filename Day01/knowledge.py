'''
Just for clarification, these knowledge.py files will be used to store ideas that I learnt for the day.
Also note that not all of these will necesarrily be the same length, just depends on how much effort I feel like putting in on the day.

#===============================================================

#1 - VARIABLE SWAP
a = 2
b = 7

#we could create a temporary variable to swap as such
tmp = a
a = b
b = a

#or we can do a single line instant swap with python
a, b = b, a

#===============================================================

#2 - CODE INTELLIGENCE
#intellisense, code intelligence or linting

#===============================================================

#3 - SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS FROM LIBRARIES
# I attempted to bypass a flawed test case using the random library to succeed the only two test cases
import random
random.randint(3, 8) # 3,4,5,6,7,or 8 

#decided to test using from keyword to extract specific function randint
from random import randint
randint(1,2) # 1 or 2
