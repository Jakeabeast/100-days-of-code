# 100-days-of-code

## Who Am I?
My name's Jacob, I prefer Jake though.
I enjoy Music, Games, Drawing, AI, Designing and most importantly Dragons!
I'm looking to become a software engineer and hoping this challenge will help create a portfolio and showcase my dedication.

## Description
This is a 100 day long course from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?kw=100&src=sac&couponCode=2021PM20).
The idea is to follow the course and learn new concepts through videos, quizzes, and exercises.
At the end of the learning day, we use the knowledge to build a project. 
Each day takes me around 2 - 3 hours of time (sometimes more for harder projects.)

&nbsp;
## Knowledge File
[Knowledge](knowledge.py). This file contains daily knowledge of some new concepts I explored for the day. 
Whether the concept was used or simply looked into out of curiousity, I added it either way (mainly for my sake).
